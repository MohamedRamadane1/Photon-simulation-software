# Photon-simulation-software
Software written in C using OpenGL, GLUT and GLUI. the makefile was designed to generate a .x executable. The user can create from the GUI a generator of photon, a reflector( reflect photons depending on incidence angle) and an absorbor that absorb the incident photons. the user can create absorbors and reflectors with different size and shapes and the generator can be tuned to generate photons at any directions desired. there is not limit at the number of generator, reflector and  absorbor user can create allowing for countless scenarios.The user can also upload a txt file using the GUI containing the coordinates of each elements( endpoints's coordinates and a letter designing which element to create: F: photon,P:generator,R:Reflector,A:abosrbor)
